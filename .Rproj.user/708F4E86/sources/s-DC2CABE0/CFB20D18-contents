Numerous studies have shown that lower student-to-teacher ratios facilitate a better learning environment for students, especially those in primary school. Our data demonstrates that across high schools, middle schools, and primary schools in DC, most schools (>75%) fall below the national 15.3 average ratio (source: Brookings Institute). Nevertheless, there are numerous outliers in DC high schools and primary schools that could potentially be targeted for class-size reduction policies.
